Now Click on "Manage participants" at the bottom Next to the Screen share icon, Then "Click Ingress" tab at the top Right of the "Manage participants" Window, Select "Create new ingress" Select WHIP (Recommended) or RTMP These both Work the Recommended is what Rumble Studio Recommends, After Selecting Ingress type of Your choosing, Give it a Name I Would call it "OBS Studio" But this field is Optional.
