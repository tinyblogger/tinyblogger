## Showing You how to Moderate your Rumble Chat

Rumble, the free speech streaming platform, has become a popular choice for many streamers who value the freedom to express themselves without the heavy moderation found on other platforms. However, with this freedom comes the responsibility of ensuring that your live chat remains a welcoming and safe space for all viewers. Unmoderated chats can quickly devolve into chaos, with misuse of free speech creating a toxic environment. This guide will provide you with the tools and know-how to effectively manage your Rumble live stream chat.

### Why Moderation is Important

Moderating your live chat is crucial to:
- **Maintain a Positive Community**: Ensure that discussions remain respectful and inclusive.
- **Protect Viewers**: Shield your audience from harassment, hate speech, and other harmful content.
- **Enhance Viewer Experience**: A well-moderated chat can improve the overall experience for your viewers, encouraging them to return and participate.

### Tools Provided by Rumble for Chat Moderation

Rumble offers several tools to help streamers moderate their live chats effectively. Here’s a rundown of these tools:

### 1. **Chat Filters**

Rumble’s chat filters allow you to automatically block certain words or phrases from appearing in your chat. This is useful for preventing spam, hate speech, or any other undesirable content.

- **How to Set Up Chat Filters**:
  - Go to your Rumble dashboard.
  - Navigate to the “[Moderation](https://rumble.com/account/moderation/flagged-phrases)” section.
  - Add the words or phrases you want to filter out.

### 2. **Moderators**

Appointing moderators can help you manage your chat more effectively. Moderators can monitor chat activity and take actions such as muting or banning users who violate your chat rules.

- **How to Add Moderators**:
  - Go to your Rumble dashboard.
  - Click on “Moderation” under the “[Moderators](https://rumble.com/account/moderation/moderators)” tab.
  - Enter the usernames of the people you want to appoint as moderators.

### 3. **Slow Mode**

Slow mode helps manage fast-moving chats by limiting how often users can post messages. This gives moderators more time to review messages and helps prevent spam.

- **How to Enable Slow Mode**:
  - Go to your live stream.
  - Click the 3 Dots menu and Select Slow Mode.

- **How to Block Users From Your Streams**:
  - Go to your Rumble Dashboard.
  - Under "Moderation" section.
  - Go to "[Mute](https://rumble.com/account/moderation/muting)" enter the Offending Users "Username" to Mute.

### Best Practices for Chat Moderation

In addition to using Rumble’s tools, here are some best practices to ensure effective chat moderation:

### Set Clear Rules

Establish clear rules for your chat and make them visible to all viewers. This can include guidelines on acceptable language, behavior, and the types of discussions allowed.

### Communicate with Your Moderators

Regularly communicate with your moderators to ensure they understand your expectations and guidelines. Provide them with the necessary training and support to handle difficult situations.

### Engage with Your Community

Actively engage with your viewers and encourage positive interactions. Lead by example and foster a respectful and inclusive community.

### Conclusion

While Rumble’s commitment to free speech is commendable, it’s important to balance this freedom with responsible moderation to maintain a positive and safe environment for your viewers. By utilizing Rumble’s moderation tools and following best practices, you can create a welcoming community that encourages healthy and respectful discussions.
